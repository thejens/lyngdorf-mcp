The TDAI-1120\u2019s IR and trigger connections \ncan also be programmed for use in a home automation system.  \n \nControl Via Network \nOpen a TCP connection on port 84 and use the control protocol as described in this document. For \ncontrol from a PC, use Telnet, Putty, or similar programs to open the TCP connection. \n \nIf you do not know the IP address of the TDAI-1120 on your local network, the TDAI-1120 supports \nApple\u00b4s Bonjour Discovery service, which must be on the computer you want to set up the TDAI-\n1120 with. The software is built-in as part of the Apple OS X operating system. For Windows \noperating systems, the software can be found at http://www.apple.com/support/bonjour/ \n \nThe control protocol is announced via bonjour as the service \u201cslactrl\u201d. \n \n \nThe TDAI-1120 can also be controlled via the network by accessing http://TDAI-1120.local in your \nbrowser. \n \n \n \n \nLyngdorf Audio TDAI-1120 \u2013 External control manual \n3 \nControl Protocol \nCommands \nEvery command starts with \u2018!\u2019 character and ends with carriage return (ascii 0x0D, referred to in \nthis document as <CR>). There are two types of commands: commands and status requests. \nCommands are used to emulate remote key presses or to set a certain volume etc. Status \nrequests are used to query the current state of the controller (volume, current source etc.). \nCommands with invalid formats are simply ignored. For example, sending a \ncommand !VOL(100)garbage!MUTEON<CR> will only result in volume being muted, because \nvolume command is not terminated properly. \n \nResponses and Feedback Level \nThere are three levels of responsiveness, called feedback levels. Each level adds something new \nto the previous level. Feedback levels can be set from the control interface with command \n\u201c!VERB(X)<CR>\u201d (X can be 0, 1 or 2). All responses start either with \u2018!\u2019 (status messages) or \u2018#\u2019 \n(echo messages) and end with <CR>. \n \nFeedback level 0: Data is sent only when data is requested by a status request command. For \nexample, command \u201c!VOL?<CR>\u201d would return \u201c!VOL(XXX)<CR>\u201d, where \u201cXXX\u201d would be current \nvolume. \n \nFeedback level 1: Feedback level 1: Data is sent whenever any status changes. The data format is \nthe same as for responses to status request commands.  \n \nFeedback level 2: Each command is also echoed back with the \u2018#\u2019 in front of the command instead \nof \u2018!\u2019 character. For example, command \u201c!VOL?<CR>\u201d would return \n\u201c#VOL?<CR>!VOL(XXX)<CR>\u201d. \n \n \n \nLyngdorf Audio TDAI-1120 \u2013 External control manual \n4 \nThe following commands and requests are available on the TDAI-1120: \n \n \nCommands \n& Requests \nReturn format \nValues \nDescription \n!AUDIOSTATUS? !AUDIOSTATUS \n(\"Audiostring\") \nAudiostring is a string describing \nthe current audio input. \nRequests format information for the \ncurrent audio input. \n!BAL? \n!BAL(balance) \nBalance describes the balance \nsetting in this range: \nL1 to L10: Balance is to the left. \n0: Balance is centered \nR1 - R10: Balance is to the right \nRequests the current balance trim \nsetting \n!BAL(balance) \n- \nBalance describes the balance \nsetting in this range: \nL1 to L10: Balance is to the left. \n0: Balance is centered \nR1 - R10: Balance is to the right \nSets the balance trim setting \n!BASS? \n!BASS(n) \nn = -12 to 12 (dB) \nRequests the current bass gain trim \nsetting \n!BASS(n) \n- \nn = -12 to 12 (dB) \nSets the bass gain trim setting \n!BASSFREQ? \n!BASSFREQ(n) \nn = 20 to 800 (Hz) \nRequests the current bass \nfrequency trim setting \n!BASSFREQ(n) \n- \nn = 20 to 800 (Hz) \nSets the bass frequency trim setting \n!DEVICE? \n!DEVICE(TDAI-1120) \n- \nRequests identifying information. \n!IPWIFI? \n!IPWIFI(xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) \nIP for the Wi-Fi interface.
