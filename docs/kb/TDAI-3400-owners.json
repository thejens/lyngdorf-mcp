A traditional setup of speakers requires\nuneven distances to back and side walls to avoid having the reflections arrive to the listening position at\nthe same time, as this would have a negative effect to the frequency response. Having strong\nreflections after each other is though causing smearing of the sound and reduces the overall dynamic\nperformance.\n\nRoomPerfect™ is designed to analyze and correct for the negative effects that the listening room has\non the speaker sound. Correcting the frequency response only, the setup of speakers should focus on\nhaving the optimal dynamic performance by positioning all speakers as close to the back wall as\npossible – and the sub(s) preferably into the front corners of the room\n\nOther correction systems will at their best offer a range of target curves for the calibration, whereas\nRoomPerfect™ will identify the sound properties of your speakers and use these for the calibration.\n\nRoomPerfect™ is therefore not just an equalizer, but in fact the only true room correction system.\n\n```\nIf you want to change the target curve (the tonal balance of your speakers) for the\ncalibration, you can enter your own pre-eq filter design under the Output Setup.\nThrough a new calibration process, RoomPerfect™ will then clean up the new tonal\nbalance.\n```",

For each section, you can choose between certain\nfilter designs, which then in combination will give you the total correction of the Voicing.\nFor each Voicing you will see a green line showing the total correction as well a blue line showing the\ncorrection caused by the selected filter section. If there is only one active filter section, only the blue line\nis shown. You can select between following filter designs:\n\n- Low Pass: Functions as a crossover filter reducing the signal above the frequency.\n- High Pass: Functions as a crossover filter reducing the signal below the frequency.\n- Low Shelf: Attenuates the lower frequencies to a specified level.\n- High Shelf: Attenuates the higher frequencies to a specified level.\n- Parametric: Attenuates specific frequency.\n\nAll these filters can be with positive or negative gain – effectively reversing the effect of the filter.\n\nYou can adjust the Overall gain for each voicing in order to be able to switch between voicings without\nexperience any change in perceived level.\n\nIn this example (Action Movie Voicing) you will see the combined effect of two filter sections:\n\n- Negative High Shelf from 120 Hz –\n    creating a boost in the bass region\n- Negative High Shelf from 8,000 Hz\n    reducing the highest frequencies\n- Overall gain set to +6 dB as\n    compensation for the reduction in\n    overall level experienced with the\n    two filters.\n\nTry experimenting by creating your own\nVoicings and test the functionality of the\ndifferent filter sections.\n\n\n**Audio Setup**",

This happens if the sound\nvolume has been muted or a cable is disconnected.\n\n- Check the sound volume.\n- Check all cable connections, including interconnects, speakers, amplifiers, etc.\n- Check the measuring signal volume.\nIf none of these measures solve the error, contact your nearest Lyngdorf Audio representative or\nLyngdorf Audio for a replacement microphone.\n\n**Fault – Signal clipping**\nEither the incoming signal has been classified as too loud, resulting in clipping or distortion, or a loud\nnoise in the immediate environment has corrupted the measurement results. If a loud noise has in fact\noccurred, such as the sound of a closing door, reduce noise levels inside and in the immediate vicinity\nof the room and repeat the measurement.
